Vision Transformer
Implementation of Vision Transformer, a simple way to achieve SOTA in vision classification with only a single transformer encoder, in Pytorch. Significance is further explained in Yannic Kilcher's video. There's really not much to code here, but may as well lay it out for everyone so we expedite the attention revolution.

For a Pytorch implementation with pretrained models, please see Ross Wightman's repository here
